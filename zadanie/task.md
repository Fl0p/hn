# **AI Assistant for Administrative Decision-Making — Translation (EN)**

## **1. Introduction — Description of the organization, situation, and current state**

In short, the Department of Tourism of the Ministry of Sport and Tourism designs administrative decisions related to tourism development programming, market regulation, professional qualifications in tourism, hotel categorization, business activity bans, as well as support programs and inspections of tourism-related entities in Poland. These are complex cases with extensive documentation and high importance for entrepreneurs, often lasting many years.

Administrative decisions must be made under conditions of limited material resources, a small team of adjudicators with frequent staff turnover, and strict time constraints. Additionally, the complexity and interactions of decisions, along with environmental risk and uncertainty, require exceptional caution and diligence in the decision-making process.

Public administration increasingly aims for a managerial style of governance and the adoption of modern IT solutions, including AI-based technologies. Using data collected over the years, it is possible to develop tools that support adjudicators in performing their duties.

## **2. Challenge**

An AI assistant for adjudicators in public administration is an advanced tool that supports officials in managing administrative cases.
The system automatically summarizes case files, extracting key information for quick analysis, reminds users of important deadlines and procedures to ensure timeliness and legal compliance.
Additionally, the assistant generates draft responses and documents, facilitating the preparation of official letters and decisions, significantly accelerating and streamlining adjudication processes.

Thanks to integration with public administration systems and the latest AI technologies, the tool improves work efficiency, reduces workload, and increases the quality of services provided to citizens.

The system supports not only individual tasks but also helps maintain high quality and compliance of administrative processes — which is crucial given rising requirements for transparency, data security, and legal regulations.

## **3. Expected Result**

The AI assistant should provide the following functionalities:

### **Support in case analysis and decision-making**

* Automatic collection and real-time analysis of factual information — summarizing procedural documentation.
* Preliminary risk assessment and probability analysis of outcomes based on historical data and legal regulations.
* Proposing possible decisions or recommendations with justifications to assist the adjudicator.

### **Process facilitation and workflow optimization**

* Automation of routine tasks such as document preparation, drafting decisions, and managing deadlines.
* Integration with public registers and databases for quick access to required information.
* Monitoring case status and supporting work organization, including reminders of upcoming deadlines.

### **Ensuring legal compliance and ethics**

* Verification of decisions for compliance with applicable law and principles of natural justice.

### **Interactive communication and decision support**

* Natural communication in legal and administrative language, allowing users to ask questions and receive clear answers.
* Analysis of large datasets using NLP, machine learning, and predictive analytics to identify trends and patterns.

### **Security and privacy**

* Ensuring confidentiality of parties involved in proceedings.
* Compliance with data protection and information security regulations.

These functionalities increase adjudicator efficiency, improve decision quality and speed, and support transparency and accountability in public administration.

The end users are employees of the Department of Tourism, but the solution should be universal and transferable to any government or local administration office.

## **4. Formal Requirements**

Submitted projects must include:

* Project title
* Detailed description of the assistant's functions (document analysis, response generation, decision support, workflow monitoring, deadlines, etc.)
* A PDF presentation (max. 10 slides)
* A video (max. 3 min) hosted in a public repository, demonstrating the project
* Screenshots, clickable model
* Demo links
* Graphic materials or other related elements

## **5. Technical Requirements**

Projects must include:

* Code repository
* Description of safety mechanisms (guardrails)
* Technology and architecture description
* Description of language model selection adapted to public administration needs
* Integration plan with existing legal and administrative systems (official document databases, court decisions, document generation tools, recommendations)
* Use case description and objectives
* Technical specification and architecture
* Declared response time
* Quality assurance and evaluation methodology
* Security and data protection aspects
* Deployment and operational plan for governmental environments
* Compliance with legal and technical standards
* (Optional but preferred) use of open-source or free technologies; paid models are allowed but less preferred

## **6. Testing and Validation Method**

Tests will verify:

* Overall system concept and alignment with intended goals
* Usability and speed
* Qualitative and quantitative evaluation of generated responses, with experts and end-users
* Simulation of real adjudication scenarios to assess accuracy, precision, and completeness
* Data security evaluation and compliance with GDPR and administrative regulations

## **7. Available Resources**

The Ministry provides ~300 archived administrative decisions (with input data), access to current legal regulations and expert knowledge.
A database of court decisions (CBOSA) must be retrieved and mapped.
Anonymized, scanned samples will be available at the MSiT booth.

## **8. Evaluation Criteria**

Five criteria (total 100%):

* Relevance to challenge — 30%
* Efficiency and speed — 20%
* Security and data protection — 20%
* Project completeness — 10%
* Implementation potential — 20%

## **9. Additional Notes / Implementation Context**

The tool is planned for deployment, continuous training, and development based on collected adjudication data.

## **10. Contact**

Mentors from the Department of Tourism will be available on Discord and at the event booth.
